## Projects

## Botium Toys Security Audit

## Overview
This repository contains the materials and results from a comprehensive internal security audit conducted for Botium Toys, a small U.S. business with growing online and international operations. The audit focused on identifying vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Project Description
The security audit was conducted to evaluate Botium Toys' security posture, focusing on the following areas:
- **Asset Management:** Assessing the company's ability to track and protect its IT assets.
- **Access Control:** Evaluating the effectiveness of controls like least privilege, separation of duties, and password policies.
- **Data Protection:** Reviewing the encryption practices for sensitive customer information, particularly credit card data.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Analyzing the preparedness of the company in the event of a system failure or data breach.
- **Compliance:** Ensuring the company adheres to relevant standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC.

## Key Findings
- **High Risk:** Inadequate asset management and lack of encryption for sensitive data.
- **Medium Risk:** Absence of a disaster recovery plan and weak password policies.
- **Compliance Issues:** Non-compliance with several GDPR and PCI DSS requirements.

## Recommendations
- Implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to monitor and respond to suspicious activities.
- Enforce stronger password policies and adopt a centralized password management system.
- Develop and regularly test a disaster recovery plan.
- Encrypt sensitive customer data, particularly credit card information, to ensure confidentiality.
- Conduct regular compliance reviews to stay aligned with industry regulations.
